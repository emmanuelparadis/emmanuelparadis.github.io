<h1>Research</h1>

My works may be grouped in three topics (see below). My past research
was on population dynamics of small mammals and of birds, chaos in
(meta)population models, and the evolution of dispersal (see below).

<h2>Phylogenetic Diversification</h2>

This has been my main research topic for twelve years. The main idea
driving my research in this area is that phylogenetic trees give
information about past events of speciation and extinction&mdash;the
drivers of the diversity of Life. This approach is attractive because
the fossil record, long considered as the best record of past
diversification events, has many pitfalls, especially for
terrestrial organisms. However, phylogenies of recent species must be
analysed with care to infer speciation and extinction rates. I have
developed several methods in order to combine phylogenetic and
taxonomic data [27], to test the effects
of species traits on speciation rate [32],
or to fit a given theoretical distribution to the distribution of
branching times [12].<br><br>

I have also devoted some effort to assess the statistical performance
of these methods and others [29, 36]. Recently, I have developed
equations for the general time-dependent birth&ndash;death model; from
these I have derived algorithms to simulate phylogenetic trees under
any model of diversification, and have developed a method for
fitting these models to phylogenetic data. These new results allow to
quantify the limits of inference on diversification with phylogenies.<br><br>

<h2>Phylogenetic Analysis of Comparative Data</h2>

My contribution to this field was to develop the use of generalised
estimating equations (GEEs) for the analysis of comparative data in
collaboration with Julien Claude. GEEs can be seen as a generalisation
of generalised least squares (GLS, a statistical procedure for fitting
regression models to correlated observations) to non-normal responses
(in the same way that generalised linear models generalise ordinary least squares).<br><br>

Julien Claude also worked during his Ph.D. on the geometric assessment
of morphological evolution in turtles [25, 31].<br><br>

We applied the GEE-based comparative method to the issue of life
history evolution in cichlid fishes in African great lakes [37].
This work showed evidence for parallel evolution towards decreased fecundity
in the three lakes, Tanganyika, Malawi, and Victoria. The
phylogenetic reconstruction further evidenced that this evolution
occurred independently in pelagic and rocky habitats within a lake.
Strikingly, other groups of pelagic fishes (including in the same
lakes) display high fecundity with numerous small eggs. The fact that
cichlids in the same habitat evolved in a different direction indicates
the importance of lineage-effect and that natural selection does not
act in a simple way.

<h2>Coalescence and Past Population Dynamics</h2>

Kingman's coalescent is a mathematical model of genealogical
relationships in large populations. There are similarities between
these genealogies and the phylogenies used to depict the relationships
among species, and both can be studied with tree-like
structures. Furthermore, DNA sequences are the main data used to infer them [21].

I started to work on the coalescent during a collaboration with Johan
Michaux. Palearctic mammals have undergone drastic changes in
distribution during ice ages. Johan has conducted a large scale
investigation to track these changes with genetic data. I
contributed some coalescent analyses on three species: <i>Apodemus
sylvaticus</i> [26], <i>A. flavicollis</i> [30]), and <i>Clethrionomys
glareolus</i> [34].

My current interest in this topic is in modelling complex population
growth with DNA sequences.

<h2>Past Projects</h2>

<h3>Large-scale Population Dynamics of British Birds</h3>

This was my post-doc project, a collaboration between the University
of East Anglia (Norwich) and the British Trust of Ornithology (BTO). The
main contribution from this project was a large scale study on the
patterns of dispersal in British birds using the ringing database of
the BTO [10].  I also developed a method for fitting continuous
dispersal models to distribution of dispersal distances ([22]; ask me
for the R code), as well as large scale analyses of population
synchrony [15, 20], breeding success [18], and density dependence
[23].

<h3>Chaos in Metapopulation Dynamics</h3>

The issue of chaotic dynamics in natural populations attracted my
attention in the context of spatial structure. I found out that most
predictions of chaos are very sensitive to some assumptions of the
models used for simulations [7, 8].

<h3>Population Dynamics of the Mediterranean Pine Vole</h3>

This was my Ph.D. work focused on the Mediterranean Pine Vole (<i>Microtus
duodecimcostatus</i>). The interest of this species is its relatively
stable population dynamics compared to others voles which have
"cyclic" dynamics [1&ndash;6, 13].
